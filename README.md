# TheftSpy
“TheftSpy” has been developed for Android based devices for tracking a lost or stolen mobile phone. As the use of android 
based smartphones and tablets is increasing, many scenarios related to mobile theft have already been proposed and many softwares have also been developed. However, most of these applications are not freely available and not accurate enough in providing the exact location of the device for example, GPS tracking, hence, making it difficult to catch hold of the thief. This app proposes a 
new technique which enhances the present scenario by using technologies like email and SMS. Once this application is installed
on the smartphone, it runs in the background and stores the current SIM number and keeps checking for SIM removal or change, 
network change, and low battery. Whenever the app detects either of these activities, it notifies the owner of the device's location details by SMS and email which was provided by the user during registration. It also supports password on shutdown feature which is activated when the device's power button is long pressed. The app will email and SMS the location of the device on
entering the wrong password. The main advantage of this application is that it is easy to install and does not require any configurations and keeps running in the background without interrupting the user.
